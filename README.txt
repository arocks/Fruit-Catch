ABOUT THE GAME
===============

You are a slightly less ambitious but picky hero who is interested in
falling fruits. There are fruits falling all over the place and you
have to stand directly under them to get them. If you get a Tomato, a
non-fruit, the game ends.

HOW TO PLAY
=============

Run the game with the following command:

    python fruitcatch.py

Move your mouse left and right to move the hero. Collecting each fruit
earns you points.
